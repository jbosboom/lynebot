lynebot
=======

Purpose
-------

lynebot solves puzzles from the puzzle game
[LYNE](http://store.steampowered.com/app/266010/), including limited automation
to parse Lyne's graphics and submit solutions with mouse clicks.

Building
--------

`ant fetch; ant compile`

Running
-------

`Effector.main` will solve up to 25 consecutive puzzles (i.e., a puzzle set).

TODO
----

With just a bit more effort, the automation could be extended to the menus as
well, allowing the bot to play though all the puzzles without assistance.
